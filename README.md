# Cross-Sell Success Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository houses a classification model designed to predict cross-sell success for The Apprentice Chef, a leading meal kit delivery company. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior and characteristics, offering insights into the likelihood of customers making additional purchases.

## Key Features

- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted meaningful information from the 'EMAIL' variable and introduced new features like 'SPAM,' 'WHOLE_MEALS,' and 'total_MEALS' to enhance model accuracy.

- **Python and scikit-learn:** Built using Python programming language and the scikit-learn library for machine learning.

## Model Development

The model development process involves:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature selection and engineering
3. Train-test split
4. Utilization of various classification algorithms
5. Evaluation of model performance using a confusion matrix
